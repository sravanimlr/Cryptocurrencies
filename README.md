# Cryptocurrencies
Using supervised machine learning techniques to analyze and visualize a cryptocurrency dataset. 

## Project Summary 
This project focused on performing data preprocessing and stadardization PCA steps for a crytocurrency dataset. The data was transformed to only contain what was needed before it was set in a K means model to create an elbow curve. After that was created, the data was visualized using a 3D plot as well as a scatterplot. After performing the project, it was clear that this project showed visually the success of certain coins versus others as the coins supplied and mined were always compared to one another.
